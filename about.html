          I am a junior at Lehigh University pursuing an Integrated Degree in Engineering and Arts and Sciences 
          (IDEAS), specializing in computer science and design. I have interests in UX/UI design, human-computer 
          interaction, and tech policy. 
          </p>
          <p>
          IDEAS is an honors program in which students can essentially “build their own degree” across many 
          fields of study. Problem-solving has always been a talent of mine and in combination with my creative 
          nature and passion for social justice and politics, my degree was born. 
          </p>

          Over the years, I’ve watched the internet and all of its potential come to life. As a member of 
          Generation Z, I have an intimate relationship with and understanding of social media – what it is, 
          what it does, and how it has made me feel and behave personally. The essay I wrote and submitted in 
          my application to Lehigh was actually about my tumultuous relationship with social media and the 
          anxiety it had given me in high school. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Now that I’m a little older, and I’d like to think a little wiser, I can not only analyze and 
          understand social media and the internet, but also my feelings towards it and my behaviors as a 
          result of it. With this understanding and background in computer science and design, I want to share 
          my knowledge with others and provide the best online experience possible because it is possible.
